# Transformation

We are given a file that has chinese text, simple translation doesn't work (obviously), what we have to do here is first to decode the chinese character to hex and then convert that to ascii. 

Refer the following code,

![Transformation](https://github.com/nAYANko/picoCTF/assets/147973815/494fe16a-ab36-42b4-9cc3-38f116bce972)

We can put this text on an online decoder to get the flag : "picoCTF{16_bits_inst34d_of_8_0ddcd97a}"
