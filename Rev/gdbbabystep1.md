# GDB Baby Step 1 
We open the file in the workspace and check the file type

` file debugger0_a `

``` debugger0_a: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=15a10290db2cd2ec0c123cf80b88ed7d7f5cf9ff, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped ```

Now we know the file is an ELF 64-bit executable non stripped file, now run gdb debugger and check all functions by typing 'info functions'

` gdb debugger0_a `

All defined functions:

Non-debugging symbols:

0x00000000000011b0  __libc_csu_fini
0x00000000000011b8  _fini 
```
Since we need to look into the main function we 

` disassemble main `


```
Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x0000000000001129 <+0>:	endbr64 
   0x000000000000112d <+4>:	push   %rbp

   0x0000000000001138 <+15>:	mov    $0x86342,%eax

   0x000000000000113e <+21>:	ret    
End of assembler dump.
```
We need to find the entry in the eax register which is '0x86342'

```
>>>print(int(0x86342))
549698
```

Hnece the flag is 
"picoctf{549698}"
