# Trasnposition-trial

Either do it manually or use this tool 'https://tholman.com/other/transposition/' , this takes out some manual effort and arranges the flag in a column of size 3 which is specified in the question, now rearraging the
columns to get the corrected pairing we get the final flag in readable format, move the last column to first position or just read the flag in order 3-1-2.

Flag: picoCTF{7R4N5P051N6_15_3XP3N51V3_56E6924A}
