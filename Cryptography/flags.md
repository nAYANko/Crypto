# Flags
We are given an encrypted flag which seems to be International Naval Code, on decrypting using the key, we find that some flags are missing, checking the US navy flags we find that the number flags are different from the international, we get the flag on decrypting.

Flag: PICOCTF{F1AG5AND5TUFF}
