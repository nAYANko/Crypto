# Wave a Flag
Here we are given an ELF file, warm, but when we try to execute it using `./warm` it says permission denied, so i tried changing file permissions to make it executable using `chmod +x warm`, then try to execute the file and it shows a message telling us to pass a -h with the command to access the help section to see what the file can do.
Passing that argument it gives us the flag : "picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_30e77291}"
