# Cookies

So in this challenge we are given a website which generates a response in relation to the name of a cookie, on inspecting the page and checking for cookies, we find out that for each type of cookie there is a value given in response. '-1' is the value for an error and returns us to home screen, rest all values respond to a cookie.
Here either we can change values manually and see the response or we can use burpsuite.
