# Some assesmbly required 1

On inspecting the js file on the site, we find that it is fetching an input into web assembmly, the checking the wasm file given to us we see that a string compare
is being run between the input and a predefined text, this is followed by a lot of assembly code, if we scroll to the bottom we can find the flag. Thank god i didnt have to figure out that assembly code.
